## Problem Statement

[WHO] experiences [WHAT PROBLEM] when [SITUATION].

This causes [NEGATIVE OUTCOME] resulting in [MEASURABLE IMPACT].

Current solutions fail because [REASON].

<!-- 
Example:
Solo founders experience context loss and mid-build confusion when returning to complex projects after any break.

This causes abandoned projects and wasted effort resulting in 60%+ of side projects never shipping.

Current solutions fail because documentation is front-loaded (only useful at start) and doesn't provide executable task sequences that survive interruption.
-->

## Vision

[ONE SENTENCE describing the end state when this project succeeds.]

When complete, users will be able to [CAPABILITY] without [CURRENT FRICTION].

<!--
Example:
A complete project framework that produces executable task lists any agent can follow from start to ship.

When complete, founders will be able to pause and resume projects at any time without losing momentum or context.
-->

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Baseline or N/A] | [Goal] | [How measured] |
| [Metric 2] | [Baseline or N/A] | [Goal] | [How measured] |
| [Metric 3] | [Baseline or N/A] | [Goal] | [How measured] |

<!--
Example:
| Projects shipped | 40% completion rate | 80% completion rate | Track project outcomes |
| Time to resume | 30+ min context rebuild | <5 min | Time from opening project to productive work |
| Agent drift | Frequent menu-offering | Zero menus mid-build | Monitor agent behavior patterns |
-->

## Scope

### In Scope

- [Feature/capability 1]
- [Feature/capability 2]
- [Feature/capability 3]
- [Feature/capability 4]

### Out of Scope

- [Explicitly excluded item 1]
- [Explicitly excluded item 2]
- [Explicitly excluded item 3]

### Deferred to Future

- [Item for v2] — v2
- [Item for v2] — v2
- [Item for v3] — v3

<!--
Example:
In Scope:
- Complete 10-document framework
- Templates for each document
- Change Protocol definition
- Validation criteria for audit

Out of Scope:
- Automated document generation tooling
- Visual diagram editors
- Integration with project management tools

Deferred:
- Framework customization per project type — v2
- Multi-project portfolio view — v2
- AI agent training materials — v3
-->

## Assumptions

| Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Mitigation |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| [Assumption 1] | [Impact if false] | [Backup plan] |
| [Assumption 2] | [Impact if false] | [Backup plan] |
| [Assumption 3] | [Impact if false] | [Backup plan] |

<!--
Example:
| Users will follow the framework | Framework provides no value if ignored | Make compliance easy, non-compliance painful |
| AI agents can execute task sequences | Core value prop fails | Test with multiple agents during development |
| Projects can be fully specified upfront | MTS becomes invalid mid-build | Change Protocol handles deviations |
-->

---

## Constraints

| Type | Constraint | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Time | [Deadline or timeline] | [Why this limit exists] |
| Budget | [Amount or "Solo/bootstrap"] | [Why this limit exists] |
| Technical | [Technical limitation] | [Why this limit exists] |
| Resource | [Resource limitation] | [Why this limit exists] |

<!--
Example:
| Time | MVP in 2 weeks | Need to validate before building Bunker |
| Budget | $0 - solo effort | Bootstrap phase |
| Technical | Markdown-only (no custom tooling) | Must work in any environment |
| Resource | Single person execution | Solo founder constraint |
-->
